# IOT-based-automatic-solar-tracker
With every passing year solar energy is becoming more prevalent across the world due exhaustible nature of fossil fuels. In the process of taking maximum output through solar energy we are here with our project " Automatic solar energy" to take maximum benefit out of solar energy. One way to do this is to have the movable panel, always facing the sun in the sky.This allows optimal energy collection, making solar panels more efficient.The active systems are a bit different. Both require a processing system, as well as actuators to move the panels. One way to actively control solar panels is to transmit the Sun's position to the panels. The panels then orient themselves to this position in the sky. To control a solar tracker, this method is by using sensors to detect the sun's position. By using Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs), its possible to detect varying light levels. These sensors are then used to determine where the sun is in the sky, allowing the panel to orient itself appropriately. All the components and software used is mentioned below:-
1. Arduino UNO
2. 2Servos
3. 3 Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs)
4. 3 10k Ohm Resistors.
